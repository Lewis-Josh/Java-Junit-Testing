# Java-Junit-Testing
Java Class Creation with Parameter Constructor with Input Validation with accompanying JUnit Test Code.

These were school projects to develop our usage of JUnit Testing and unit testing in general, these were written in Java.

  These assignments had varied requirements: Maximum lenghts for inputs, inputs cannot be null etc. I repetedly referenced the requiements when developing the code and incorporated them into the program. Understanding the intent of a program and how the client wants it to perform is critical to software development. I always attempt to create clean, industry usable code that follows best practices so that my code is easily readable (by others than myself.) I ensured that my code was functional and secure via my unit testing, access modifiers and methods I implemented. I usually prefer a waterfall methodology when developing my software though this was my first experience unit testing. In a later c++ project (which is in a different repository) I actually developed unit tests for the program before writing the code because I was working with a new concept (maps) and wanted to test my maps to understand how they worked before developing.
