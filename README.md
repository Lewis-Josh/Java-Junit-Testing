# Java-Junit-Testing
Java Class Creation with Parameter Constructor with Input Validation with accompanying JUnit Test Code.

This was a school project to develop our usage of JUnit Testing.
  The objective was to create a Task Array List to store a list of tasks each with parameters of a unique ID that cannot be Null or greater than 10 characters, nor can the unique ID be modified.
Each task also has a name parameter which cannot be Null or greater than 20 characters and each task also requires a description parameter which cannot be Null or greater than 50 characters.
